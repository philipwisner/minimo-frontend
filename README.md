"A minimalist blogging and thought capturing platform"

<br/>

## Introduction
Minimo was created as my final project for the Ironhack Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Barcelona I was tasked to create a MEAN stack app that had at least 3 data models. I couldn't really think of a unique idea, but I knew I wanted a place that I could write blogs but also individual posts. Basically I wanted to create Medium but with a blog feature. I knew that this could have at least 3 data models and could be completed in 2 weeks. And so minimo was born.

## Development
I am a very visual developer, I like to have a basic wireframe ready along with all my user stories and data models defined before I start coding. I spent the weekend before our final project defining my data models relations and user stories. I was able to have zero redundancy in my database. Everything is linked by userId, so I am never saving something twice. Then based off of that I spent the entire first day creating my wireframes which you can check out 
[here](http://philipwisner.com/images/Minimo%20Mobile.pdf).

Then I spent almost all of the second day battling Angular. I was familiar with creating an Express app with Node and MongoDB but now I had to strip back all of the excess that is generated for an express app and do everything with Angular. Since we learned Angular in just a few days, it was a struggle creating the frontend app and the backend app and then having them interface. I would generate components in the wrong area, I would mess up names. I wound up deleting the entire Angular app multiple times. By then end of the day I had them both up and running and communicating.

The next two days I was working on just the login/signup authorization. Using passport when it was just an express app was super easy for me, I had it working in less than a hour, but Angular was not having it. It took two days of troubleshooting and writing additional functions, along with lots of googling to finally get it working. 

I then fifinishedff the week and weekend creating most of the pages and components needed for minimo based off the user stories, but there wasn't much functionality yet.

I started off the final week adding all the functionality to minimo, starting with the settings page and main profile page. After that was done, I worked on adding posts to the profile. The next day I worked on creating blogs and then being able to add posts to blogs. It was at this point I had too spend some time sorting the posts to only show posts that don't belong to a blog. I had most of the major features working by Wednesday of the second week, but there was still a lot of bugs. So I spent most of that day fixing all the bugs and errors, and then at the end of the day added to photo upload ability, which took a while to get working. Then on Thursday our internal presentation day, I decided to add a global feed to the app, which of course added more bugs so I had to leave it pretty bare.

We then presented our apps to our class. You can see my presentation [here](http://slides.com/philipwisner/minimo/fullscreen#/). After that was over I spent all night just cleaning up my code, I had so much unnecessary stuff and duplicated code. I then started to cleanup the styling and layout bebecauset was very basic at this point. Then the next morning we presented to the judges and that was it.
